# CV Parsing & Scoring – Recruitment Process Optimization

## Overview
This project aims to **optimize the recruitment process** at **Forvis Mazars** by designing a **CVthèque** that integrates **automatic CV parsing** and **candidate scoring**.  
The solution reduces manual work, improves candidate evaluation quality, and accelerates hiring decisions.

## Project Context
Recruitment at scale involves:
- High volumes of CVs
- Manual and repetitive processing
- Long response times
- Risk of losing top candidates

This project applies **Business Process Reengineering (BPR)** to redesign the recruitment workflow using automation and data-driven evaluation.

## Objectives
- Map the recruitment process within the organization
- Model the current process (**As-Is**) using BPMN
- Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies
- Design an optimized process (**To-Be**) with automation
- Integrate CV parsing and scoring modules

## Scope
- CV reception (email, career site, job boards)
- Data extraction and structuring
- Candidate evaluation and ranking
- Shortlisting and manager validation
- Reporting and dashboards

Human validation is intentionally preserved.

## As-Is Process (Current State)
- Manual CV reading
- Manual data entry (Excel / ATS)
- Subjective scoring
- Email-based communication
- High processing time and error risk

## Key Issues Identified
- Bottlenecks caused by manual tasks
- Media breaks (PDF, Word, scanned CVs)
- Lack of traceability
- High operational costs
- Degraded candidate experience

## To-Be Process (Proposed Solution)
An automated CVthèque including:
- **CV Parsing** using NLP and OCR
- **Automatic scoring** based on weighted criteria
- Candidate ranking and shortlisting
- Recruiter and manager dashboards
- Automated notifications and follow-ups

## Expected Benefits
- Major reduction in processing time
- Lower recruitment costs
- Objective and consistent evaluation
- Improved candidate experience
- Scalable recruitment process
- Advanced HR analytics

## Technologies
### CV Parsing
- NLP: spaCy, NLTK
- OCR: Tesseract
- APIs: Affinda, Sovren

### Scoring
- TF-IDF
- Cosine similarity
- Machine Learning (scikit-learn, TensorFlow)

### Infrastructure
- Backend: Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js
- Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- Frontend: React or Angular
