# Project Overview

This project focuses on two key aspects: CV Parsing and Scoring. CV Parsing involves extracting relevant information from CVs (curriculum vitas) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Scoring refers to evaluating the extracted information against predefined criteria to assess the suitability of candidates for specific job roles. The ultimate goal is to streamline the recruitment process by automating these tasks, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing human bias in candidate evaluation.  

In summary, this project aims to create a robust system that helps recruiters save time and make more informed decisions based on accurately parsed and scored CV data.
