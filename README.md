# 📄 CV Parsing & Scoring – Recruitment Process Optimization

## 🔍 Overview
This project aims to **optimize the recruitment process** at **Forvis Mazars** by designing a **CVthèque** that integrates **automatic CV parsing** and **candidate scoring**.  
The solution reduces manual work, improves candidate evaluation quality, and accelerates hiring decisions.

## 🏢 Project Context
Recruitment at scale involves:
- 📥 High volumes of CVs
- ⏳ Manual and repetitive processing
- 🕒 Long response times
- ❌ Risk of losing top candidates

This project applies **Business Process Reengineering (BPR)** to redesign the recruitment workflow using automation and data-driven evaluation.

## 🎯 Objectives
- 🗺️ Map the recruitment process within the organization
- 📊 Model the current process (**As-Is**) using BPMN
- 🚧 Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies
- 🔄 Design an optimized process (**To-Be**) with automation
- 🤖 Integrate CV parsing and scoring modules

## 📌 Scope
- 📬 CV reception (email, career site, job boards)
- 🧩 Data extraction and structuring
- 🧮 Candidate evaluation and ranking
- ⭐ Shortlisting and manager validation
- 📈 Reporting and dashboards  

👉 Human validation is intentionally preserved.

## ⚙️ As-Is Process (Current State)
- 📖 Manual CV reading
- ✍️ Manual data entry (Excel / ATS)
- 🎭 Subjective scoring
- 📧 Email-based communication
- 🐢 High processing time and error risk

## 🚨 Key Issues Identified
- 🧱 Bottlenecks caused by manual tasks
- 🔀 Media breaks (PDF, Word, scanned CVs)
- 🔍 Lack of traceability
- 💸 High operational costs
- 😕 Degraded candidate experience

## 🚀 To-Be Process (Proposed Solution)
An automated CVthèque including:
- 🤖 **CV Parsing** using NLP and OCR
- 🧠 **Automatic scoring** based on weighted criteria
- 🏆 Candidate ranking and shortlisting
- 📊 Recruiter and manager dashboards
- 🔔 Automated notifications and follow-ups

## ✅ Expected Benefits
- ⏱️ Major reduction in processing time
- 💰 Lower recruitment costs
- 🎯 Objective and consistent evaluation
- 😊 Improved candidate experience
- 📈 Scalable recruitment process
- 📊 Advanced HR analytics

## 🛠️ Technologies
